Going back to our main example, we think it would be interesting to understand how much variability there is in mobility rates across colleges. We've already looked at CA vs other states, as well as UCSD in particular, but we would like to get a sense of all the data. \n",

This entails cutting up our numerical variable (mobility rates in this case) into a number of different bins, and then counting the fraction of observations that fall within each bin. Let's try it out"
