    "# Data Wrangling in STATA\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction and Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful and attractive features of STATA is how easy it is to construct and clean data. By the end of the notebook you will earn how to append datasets, merge datasets, reshape datasets and collapse datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Appending data\n",
    "\n",
    "Appending data is a simple way combine observations from two different datasets. In many datasets you will come across in the wild, the data are often stored in multiple files. For example, a file for each year or a file for each state, but when we go to data analysis, it will generally be convenient to have all the data together in the same file. For example, in the simple example given below, we have two datasets, each from a separate school. We can construct a new dataset that combines the school-specific datasets by using the ``append`` command in STATA.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/append.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<!---To append two datasets you need to be careful about being consistent with variable names across datasets. For example, if dataset 1 had named the GPA variable ``GPA`` and dataset 2 had named it ``grade_point_average``, then both variables will appear in the appended dataset, but GPA will be missing for ever student in dataset 2.--> \n",
    "\n",
    "### Merging data\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar, but slightly different scenario is when we want to ``merge`` two datasets. We do this when we have two datasets that have a common unit of observation, but potentially different variables. For example, in the simple example below, dataset 1 is a datset of students and their assigned school, while dataset 2 is a dataset of students and their grades. The goal of the ``merge`` command is to create a single dataset with student identifiers, school identifiers, and student grades:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/merge_one.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reshaping Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Often we have multiple observations for the same unit (for example, a GPA for a student each term). It is sometimes convenient to reshape the data so that we have a single observation per student. When we have multiple observations per unit, then our data is in ``long`` forma. If we have a single observation per unit, then we are in ``wide`` format. In STATA we can freely convert between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/reshape.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for reshaping can sometimes be hard to remember so don't forget to reference the ``help`` file if you find yourself forgetting how to reshape the data. "

    "## Application -- Opioid Prescriptions in the United States\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginning in the 1990s up until today, opioid usage has been skyrocketing in the United States. In this application we are going to look at opioid usage across U.S. counties. We will be particularly interested in understanding what factors, such as labor-market conditions, may be associated with opioid usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first dataset we will look at is named ``opioid_2006.dta`` and comes from the CDC [source](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/maps/rxrate-maps.html). The data reports the prescription rate for a large portion of U.S. counties. The prescription rate will be defined as the number of prescriptions (per year) per 100 people. So a prescription rate of 50 implies that in that year, there were 50 opioid prescriptions per 100 people. Because a single person can have multiple prescriptions per year, this rate is not equal to the fraction of people using opioids per year. That will be even clearer once we load the data."

After reading into this a little more, though, I discovered, that although prescriptions rates have been declining since 2012, illicit usage of close substitutes of prescription opioids, such as heroin, has been on the rise and fueling the opioid epidemic. So while legal prescriptions have been declining in recent years, overdoses due to illicit opioids has been on the rise.  \n",

    "To me, this looks like incredible variation across location. Some counties have basically zero prescriptions per person, while others have over 2 prescriptions per person. Understanding what drives this variation across locations is an incredibly important question. If we want to develop policies aimed at preventing opioid overdoses, we need to understand what is fueling the epidemic.\n",

    "One hypothesis is that poor labor-market conditions are contributing to the epidemic. The logic being that workers who are laid off are more likely to abuse opioids. The causality could also work in the opposite direction. Individuals who are addicted to opioids may have a harder time finding a job, leading to higher unemployment. Providing a clear causal relationship from unemployment to opioid usage (or vice-versa) is a difficult and nuanced problem. In this application, however, we are going to look at whether there appears to be a correlation between the two, while being careful to not over-interpret any relationship we find.\n",

Policy two is to increase local employment subsidies increase the employment rates, which will in turn decrease opioid abuse.\n",
